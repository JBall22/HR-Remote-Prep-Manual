        <h3>Hack Reactor Prep Courses</h3>
          <p>Hack Reactor does offer their own preparatory classes. These are paid classes, though you have the option of putting the admission fees towards the full immersive programs if you choose to attend any of their courses.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For beginners to coding there is <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/o/hack-reactor-remote-beta-8260605281">Hack Reactor Remote Prep.</a></li>
              <p>The course mixes lectures with solo coding and pair programming. This gives students a guided experience that allows them to establish an understanding of fundamentals through experience and by learning from each other. Pair programming has the added benefit of teaching students to communicate about code, which is a key skill in the professional world. Instructors circulate among students throughout the coding portions of the class to help students out of ruts and to iron out concepts. Class sizes are limited to 20 to allow for plenty of individual instruction.</p>
            <li>For more advanced users there is <a href="http://fulcrum.reactorcore.com/now/">Fulcrum.</a></li>
              <p>Fulcrum is the most comprehensive self-learning curriculum on JavaScript development, containing over 100 hours of material.</p>

      <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the tools of the trade. These will help get you started in the world of programming and help you to set up your development environment the way you like it.</p>

        <h3>Programming-Specific Text Editors: Choose your Weapon</h3>
          <h4><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a></h4>
            <p>Free full-featured unlimited trial, but will bug you every certain number of saves to buy the full version for $70. Runs fast and you can download some nice packages to make your life easier. Currently the preferred text editor by programmers, but Atom is catching up fast.</p>
            <h5><a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_osx.html">Useful Keyboard Shortcuts for Sublime</a></h5>
            <h5>Packages</h5>
              <p>Directories that can be installed into your text editor to give it additional functionalities, customization, or quality of life changes.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://packagecontrol.io/installation">Package Control</a></li>
                  <p>The Sublime Text package manager that makes it exceedingly simple to find, install and keep packages up-to-date. After installing this through the Sublime Text console (ctrl+`), press ctl+shift+p (Windows/Linux) or ⇧+⌘+p (OSX) to open up command menu and go to 'Package Control: Install Package' to install other packages.</p>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/Colorsublime/Colorsublime-Plugin">Colorsublime</a></li>
                  <p>A theme manager that lets you preview/install themes directly through Sublime Text from the <a href="http://colorsublime.com/">Colorsublime Repository</a>.</p>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/sergeche/emmet-sublime#readme">Emmett</a></li>
                  <p>Emmet is a web-developer’s toolkit that can greatly improve your HTML and CSS workflow. Takes snippets to a new level and lets you use your tab key after typing commands to do a number of additional useful shortcuts. Here is a handy <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/">cheat sheet</a> you can use on the fly to help get you started.</p>
              </ul>
          <h4><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></h4>
            <p>Free, Open Source, text editor by Github that is relatively new to the scene but rising fast. Easily customizable and user-friendly, and integrates well with Git. Runs a bit more sluggish than alternatives, but makes up for that in other areas.</p>
            <h5>Packages</h5>
              <p>Can be accessed by opening the preferences menu under Atom and navigating to packages or themes to see current ones, and install to get new ones. No need for package control or theme managers.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="">Emmett</a></li>
                  <p>This is a ported over version of Sublime Text's Emmett package for Atom, and it contains most of the same functionalities. Again, a useful <a href="http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/">cheat sheet</a> to get you started.</p>
                <li><a href="https://atom.io/packages/minimap">Minimap</a></li>
                  <p>For those missing the minimap feature from Sublime Text, there is no need to fear. Minimap package is here.</p>
                <li><a href="https://atom.io/packages/activate-power-mode">Power Mode</a></li>
                  <p>If you are finding the coding process a little mundane, then you can activate Power Mode! This will make you feel like you are writing code in an action movie, and also possibly annoy you a little or a lot with time. Kingdoms have been raised and been brought down with the use of Power Mode, so use with care.</p>
              </ul>

        <h3>Communication</h3>
            <h4><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a></h4>
              <p>Messaging tool used by many teams. It's easy to use and has many features essential to programmers.</p>
            <h4><a href="https://floobits.com/">Floobits</a></h4>
              <p>Pair programming is a great tool for learning to code, and Floobits lets you do it remotely, right through your text editor. First you'll need to sign up on their website(You can use your Github account) then set it up in your text editor: <a href="https://floobits.com/help/plugins/atom">Atom</a> | <a href="https://floobits.com/help/plugins/sublime">Sublime</a></p>

        <h3>Accounts, Programs, and Plugins</h3>
          <h4><a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></h4>
            <p>Github is a website that allows you to easily share git repositories. Creating an account is important as it can serve as a portfolio and store all your projects, while letting you work on them together with others as well. </p>
          <h4><a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/configuring/osx/install-xcode-command-line-tools/">XCode Command Line Tools</a> (<em>Mac</em> only)</h4>
            <p>This is a requirement for many common programming tools.</p>
          <h4><a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> (<em>Mac</em> only)</h4>
            <p>Homebrew is a package manager - that basically means it handles the proper installation and configuration of many programs you'll use as a software developer. The following programs can be easily installed with it.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Git Version Control</a></li>
                <p>The simplest way to install git is to use Homebrew by running this command in the terminal |<strong>brew install git</strong>| (<em>Mac</em> only)</p>
              <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js and NPM</a>: the LTS download is best for now</li>
                <p>Node is a way to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, while NPM is just a package manager for JavaScript programs and comes bundled along with the node download.<br>Again, you can also just install node using Homebrew by running the command |<strong>brew install node</strong>| in the terminal. (<em>Mac</em> only)</p>
            </ul>
